# AutoClicker Project Roadmap

This document outlines planned improvements and features for the AutoClicker project.

## Feature Enhancements
- [x] Add click patterns/sequences (e.g., click A then B then C in order)
- [x] Implement keyboard input simulation alongside mouse clicks
- [x] Add pause/resume functionality during operation
- [x] Include click statistics (total clicks, success rate, time elapsed)
- [x] Add sound feedback for successful clicks
- [x] Implement hotkey customization in settings
- [x] Add screenshot saving for debugging failed detections

## User Experience Improvements
- [x] Create dark mode theme option
- [x] Add tooltips and help text throughout the UI
- [x] Implement progress bars for long-running operations
- [x] Create better responsive UI layout
- [x] Add icons and visual improvements

## Configuration & Safety
- [x] Add export/import settings functionality
- [x] Create configuration profiles for different use cases
- [ ] Add command-line arguments support for GUI startup
- [x] Implement safety zones (areas to avoid clicking)
- [x] Add time limits and automatic stopping
- [x] Create emergency stop with multiple key combinations
- [x] Add click confirmation dialogs for safety

## Technical Improvements
- [x] Improve error handling with more specific error messages
- [x] Add input validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Add unit tests for core functionality
- [x] Optimize image processing performance
- [ ] Improve OCR accuracy with preprocessing options
- [ ] Add support for more image formats (WebP, TIFF, etc.)
- [ ] Add cross-platform support (Windows/Mac testing)
- [ ] Implement Wayland support for Linux

## Documentation & Support
- [x] Improve README with screenshots and examples
- [ ] Create user guide and troubleshooting documentation

## Priority Levels
- **High Priority**: Error handling, input validation, safety features, documentation
- **Medium Priority**: UI improvements, configuration features, performance optimization
- **Low Priority**: Advanced features (patterns, keyboard simulation), cross-platform support

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on safety features first to prevent accidental system interactions
- Ensure all new features maintain backward compatibility
- Add comprehensive testing for critical functionality
- Consider user feedback when prioritizing features
